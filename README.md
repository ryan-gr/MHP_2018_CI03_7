### About FPGA
FPGA is a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured after manufacturing â€“ hence "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL).

FPGAs contain an array of programmable logic blocks, and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects that allow the blocks to be "wired together", like many logic gates that can be inter-wired in different configurations. Logic blocks can be configured to perform complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic gates like AND and XOR. In most FPGAs, logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.

For our project, we used Lucid language to programme our Mojo.

### Mojo
Our Mojo comprises of 2 modes, Manual and Auto. These are the 2 main states for our FPGA.

###### Toggling between modes
Dip switch 23 is configured to switch between the mode.
Manual mode is represented by 1 on the first seven segment from the left, while Auto mode is represented by 2.

#### Manual Mode
In Manual mode, 3 switches are programmed to output data into the full adder as A,B, Cin respectively. The inputs can be seen by the led that are above the switches.

Dip switch 0 controls A
Dip switch 1 controls B
Dip switch 2 controls Cin

Through the full-adder, the FPGA receives input about the state of SUM & Carry. 
FPGA would process the input from the full adder and display it as a 2 bit data.

#### Auto Mode
In Auto mode, the output is sent out using a 3 bit data. Each bit is connected to an individual output port. The 3 input is displayed on the right 3 seven segment and it loops from 000 to 111.

#### Modules
6 modules were created in the process of the project
1.mojo_top.luc
The main file for running the mojo.
2.state_machin.luc
The finite state machine which contains our code to switch between the 2 modes and what to display on the seven_segement
3.digit_lut.luc
To configure the seven_segment to display it as a number.
4.multi_seven_seg.luc
With reference to the book "Learning FPGAs"- Alongside with decoder and digit_lut, numbers can be displayed on the led segment easily. 
5.decimal_counter.luc
Increment loop for Auto mode
6.multi_dec_ctr.luc
Trigger for the loop in Auto mode
